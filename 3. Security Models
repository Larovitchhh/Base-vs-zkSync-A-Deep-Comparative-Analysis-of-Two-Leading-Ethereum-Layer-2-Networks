Base Security

Relies on Ethereum + fraud-proof dispute mechanism

Security guarantees depend on honest challengers

Simpler codebase → fewer cryptographic failure risks

zkSync Security

Security does not depend on challengers

Mathematical certainty using ZK proofs

Complexity increases attack surface in implementation, not execution

Considered the endgame L2 security model

Verdict:
zkSync offers stronger theoretical guarantees, but Base offers battle-tested operational reliability.
