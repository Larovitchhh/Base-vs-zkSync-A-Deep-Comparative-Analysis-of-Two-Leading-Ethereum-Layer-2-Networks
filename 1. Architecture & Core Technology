Base (Optimistic Rollup)

Built on OP Stack

Uses fraud proofs (optimistic assumption)

Finality depends on a challenge window (usually ~7 days)

Easier and cheaper to implement

Robust thanks to shared modules from Optimism Collective and Coinbase

zkSync (ZK-Rollup)

Built with zero-knowledge proofs

Transactions are verified instantly using cryptography

Fast finality (seconds, not days)

More complex math → harder to implement but more secure

Two main products: zkSync Lite (payment rollup) and zkSync Era (EVM-compatible ZK-rollup)

Verdict:
ZK-rollups are the future of L2 scaling, but Optimistic Rollups still dominate due to simplicity and maturity.
