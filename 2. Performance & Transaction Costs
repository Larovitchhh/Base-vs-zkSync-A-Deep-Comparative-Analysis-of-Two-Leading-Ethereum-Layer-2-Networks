Base

Low gas thanks to data compression via OP Stack

Throughput increases as OP Stack evolves

Finality delayed because of fraud-proof window

Very stable pricing patterns

zkSync

Ultra-low gas fees (often lower than Optimistic L2s)

Faster settlement → immediate UX benefits

Batch proof generation can spike node load but not user fees

Verdict:
If your priority is speed + lowest possible gas, zkSync generally wins.
If your priority is predictable stability, Base is exceptional.
