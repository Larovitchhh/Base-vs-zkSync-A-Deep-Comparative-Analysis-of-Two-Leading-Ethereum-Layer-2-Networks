Base Ecosystem

Exploded due to Coinbase integration

Ideal for consumer apps, social apps, and miniapps (Farcaster Frames etc.)

Huge onboarding funnel via Coinbase Wallet, Onchain Summer, and Friend.tech

Excellent documentation via OP Stack

zkSync Ecosystem

Focused on high-performance DeFi & ZK-native apps

zkSync Era is nearly EVM-equivalent but still has quirks

Dev tooling improving fast but not as standardized as OP Stack

Strong push for account abstraction and native ZK applications

Verdict:
Base wins developer simplicity + massive user funnel,
zkSync wins innovation + advanced cryptographic capabilities.
